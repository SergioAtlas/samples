C++ project and  Stm32f4discovery 
Due the short time to produce a sample project, Also the fact I my projects were saved in a external hard drive running a window OS
and my currently console is a mac. I provided two small projects on in C++ and one bases on a STm32f4 discovery.
The C++ open energy consumption file ad display to the use of energy, which hypothetically is link to PV solar panel.
An Embedded project is based on Stm32f4 discovery, where after a button pressed the green light turns on for 10 msec then orange light
for another 2 sec, then the red light for 15 sec while the blue light blinks for the same period as the red, 
finally the blue light keep blinking while the orange start the sequence to blink for 5 sec at the in synchrony with the blue light when finish,
it returns in stand by with the green and blue light on
